# Gradated wash study

Video tutorials:
- [Gradated wash video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpr__HcfYM4) - this is the technique that works with a watercolor bead (wet-on-dry)
- [Gradated wash video 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8qhw4EXb08) - this video has 3 different techniques (2 wet-on-dry, 1 wet-on-wet)
- [Gradated wash video 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYXbKUfpXWQ) - 2 techniques, different variations of board angle, etc

Note: Do not like the idea to dilute the color palette itself, so not going with this technique. But can find videos on youtube with it.

**Variations to practice:**
- different pigments (Schmincke looks more stable than Daniel Smith. Try all techniques with W&N, DM and Sch and compare.)
- different types of paper
- wet-on-dry, wet-on-wet
- different board angles
